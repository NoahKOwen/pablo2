## Overview
XNRT is a React PWA off-chain gamification community earning platform where users earn in-app utility tokens (XNRT) through staking, mining, referrals, and task completion. It aims to provide a robust, secure, and engaging earning experience with a functional authentication system, automated earning mechanisms, and a comprehensive admin dashboard. The platform incorporates a complete branding refresh with professional XNRT icons and PWA assets, a smart deposit reporting system with auto-verification on BSC, and an automated deposit system with blockchain scanning.

## Recent Changes
**December 5, 2025 - Tasks Display Bug Fix:**
- Fixed "0/0 tasks" display issue on Tasks page
- Root cause: Frontend only filtered for daily/weekly/special categories, but database had tasks with mining/profile/social/staking categories
- Solution: Refactored Tasks page to dynamically display ALL task categories with appropriate icons and descriptions
- Added `assignTasksToUser()` function to automatically assign all active tasks to new users during registration
- Integrated auto-assignment into both email/password and Replit Auth registration flows

**December 1, 2025 - Tasks System Hardening & Component Refactoring:**
- Hardened task completion with Prisma transaction + atomic increments (double-completion protection)
- Fixed GET /api/tasks/user to never return undefined tasks (Map lookup + filter)
- Extracted TaskItem component from pages/tasks.tsx to components/tasks/task-item.tsx
- Removed unused task-card.tsx and task-list.tsx components
- Updated checkAndUnlockAchievements to use atomic XP increment

**December 1, 2025 - Code Refactoring & Security Improvements:**
- Refactored `server/storage.ts` (1,939 lines) into modular `server/storage/` folder with 14 domain modules
- Refactored `server/routes.ts` (3,675 lines) into modular `server/routes/` folder with 20+ route modules
- Added HTML escaping (XSS protection) to email templates for user-controlled data
- Removed `@ts-nocheck` from `shared/schema.ts` - full TypeScript type safety
- Disabled `ALLOW_VERIFY_OVERRIDE` for production security
- Added all production secrets (VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY, BREVO_API_KEY, SMTP_PASSWORD)

**November 30, 2025 - Replit Environment Setup:**
- Configured PostgreSQL database with Neon and applied all Prisma migrations
- Set up environment variables: JWT_SECRET, MASTER_SEED, blockchain settings (RPC_BSC_URL, USDT_BSC_ADDRESS, etc.)
- Configured workflow "Start application" on port 5000 with webview output
- Configured deployment for autoscale with build and run commands
- Note: Blockchain env vars currently use development defaults (XNRT_WALLET is zero address, scanner disabled). Update for production use.
- Optional features requiring additional secrets: SMTP (email), VAPID (push notifications)

## User Preferences
- **Unified Cosmic Theme System**: Users can toggle between light and dark modes, both featuring cosmic starfield backgrounds
- Light mode: Black cosmic background with golden twinkling stars and golden UI accents

## System Architecture
XNRT utilizes a robust architecture designed for performance, scalability, and security.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Design System**: Unified cosmic theme with black starfield backgrounds, a luxurious golden color palette, and glassmorphic elements.
- **Navigation**: 
  - Desktop: Collapsible sidebar with full navigation menu
  - Mobile: Modern bottom navigation bar with 5 fixed tabs (Home, Wallet, Mining, Staking, More) featuring glow effects on active tabs. "More" tab opens a floating glassmorphic drawer with grouped items organized into Account (Profile, Rewards, Achievements), Transactions (Deposit, Withdrawal), Social (Referrals, Leaderboard), Tasks & Support (Tasks, Chat Support, Logout)
- **Authentication Experience**: Glassmorphic `/auth` page with `backdrop-blur` effects, tabbed Login/Register interface, and `framer-motion` animations. Includes FloatingLabelInput and PasswordStrength components.
- **Error Handling**: `ErrorBoundary` for graceful failure recovery.
- **Loading States**: Content-aware skeleton screens.
- **Confirmation Flows**: Critical actions require user confirmation.
- **Components**: Leverages Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach with modern bottom navigation optimized for thumb-reach accessibility.
- **Animations**: `Framer-motion` for dynamic UI, `ShineButton` and `TiltCard` for engaging interactions.
- **Support**: Integrated FAQ ChatBot with smart keyword matching and email fallback, repositioned to sidebar for authenticated users.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for data management.
  - **React Deduplication**: Vite configured with `resolve.dedupe: ['react', 'react-dom']` to prevent duplicate React instances that cause hook errors
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, modular architecture:
  - `server/storage/` - 14 domain modules (users, balances, stakes, mining, referrals, transactions, tasks, notifications, activities, leaderboard, types, interface, constants, index)
  - `server/routes/` - 15 feature routers + 7 admin sub-routers for clean separation of concerns
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) using Drizzle ORM for schema and session management, and Prisma ORM for database operations.
- **Authentication**: Hybrid system supporting Replit OIDC (Passport.js) and traditional email/password, with secure password reset, email verification, and session management.
- **PWA**: Full Progressive Web App capabilities via `vite-plugin-pwa` with a custom service worker for offline SPA routing, Workbox caching, and app shortcuts.
- **Blockchain Integration**: On-chain verification for USDT deposits on Binance Smart Chain using ethers.js. Includes automated deposit system with unique personal deposit addresses (HD wallet derivation), blockchain scanner that auto-detects and credits deposits after 12 confirmations, and legacy support for wallet linking.
- **Monitoring**: Optional Sentry integration for error tracking and Web Vitals monitoring.
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization.

**Feature Specifications:**
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive management for Deposits, Withdrawals, Users, Analytics, Announcements, and Settings, including bulk deposit approval.
- **Announcements System**: Platform-wide communication system with admin CRUD interface and user-facing dismissible banners. Supports 4 priority levels (info/warning/success/error), expiry dates, and active/inactive status. Public API serves active announcements to authenticated users on home page.
- **Deposit/Withdrawal Systems**:
    - **Deposits**: USDT to XNRT conversion with unique personal deposit addresses per user. Users can deposit directly from exchanges (Binance, OKX) without wallet linking, gas fees, or blockchain interaction. HD wallet derivation (BIP44 path m/44'/714'/0'/0/{index}) generates unique BSC addresses. Automated scanner watches all user addresses and auto-credits XNRT after 12 confirmations.
    - **Withdrawals**: XNRT to USDT conversion with admin approval and tracking.
- **Earning Systems**:
    - **Staking**: Four-tiered system with varying APY, real-time countdowns, and automated daily reward distribution.
    - **Mining**: Automated 24-hour sessions with XP to XNRT conversion and automatic reward deposit.
    - **Referral**: 3-level commission chain, network visualization, leaderboard, and social sharing.
    - **Daily Check-in**: Atomic check-ins with streak rewards and anti-exploit measures.
    - **Achievement**: Auto-unlocks achievements with XP rewards.
- **XP Leaderboard System**: Weekly/monthly rankings with category filters.
- **Push Notification System**: Web Push notifications with VAPID authentication, subscription management, and event triggers.
- **Security Features**: Secure password reset and email verification systems with time-limited tokens and rate limiting.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Automation**: All core earning mechanisms and deposit systems are fully automated.
- **Security**: Implemented `requireAuth`/`requireAdmin` middleware, atomic database operations, input validation, rate limiting, `helmet`, signature verification for wallet linking, and unique constraints for transaction hashes.
- **Performance**: 
  - Lazy loading all authenticated pages (Home, Wallet, Deposit, Withdrawal, Staking, Mining, Referrals, Leaderboard, Tasks, Achievements, Rewards, Profile) for faster initial load
  - Code splitting via Vite to reduce initial bundle size
  - Optimized Prisma queries and reduced API polling
  - Workbox caching for PWA assets
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Feature flags enable phased rollout.
- **Code Quality**: Zero LSP/TypeScript errors, 100% type-safe, and E2E test coverage.
- **Database Schema Alignment**: 100% schema alignment between Drizzle and Prisma.
